                <p><i>Translating images into words: From truthful to useful</i> &mdash; <a href="https://www.coalas-lab.com/elisakreiss">Elisa Kreiss</a>, Assistant Professor at UCLA Department of Communication</p>

                <p><b>Bio:</b>

                Elisa Kreiss is an Assistant Professor of Communication at UCLA and the lab director of the Coalas (Computation and Language for Society) Lab. Previously, she completed a PhD in Linguistics at Stanford, where she was a member of Stanford’s NLP group and the Stanford Data Science Center for Open and REproducible Science (CORES). Elisa investigates how we produce and understand language situated in the visual world. Her work combines tools from natural language processing, psycholinguistics, and human-computer interaction to advance our understanding of how communicative context shapes language use. Her research has direct applications to image accessibility – the challenge of (automatically) generating image descriptions for blind and low-vision users. Elisa’s work has been supported by several Google Research Awards, the National Science Foundation, Stanford’s Human-centered AI initiative, and Stanford’s Accelerator for Learning.

                <p><b>Abstract:</b>

                    Developing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) that can easily translate between the linguistic and visual modality in human-like ways has many useful applications, including making visual content accessible to blind and low vision individuals, detecting misinformation, and combating visual illiteracy. While the current generation of VLMs has quickly risen to show human-level performance on many existing benchmarks, there remains a remarkable gap between these scores and how useful the models are found to be in practice. In this talk, I will present recent and ongoing work which suggests that in order to develop and understand the merit of Vision-Language Models for downstream application, we need to define tasks and evaluation metrics that assess the communicative usefulness of the generated texts. Specifically, I will focus on the challenge of generating image descriptions and argue for moving the goal post from what can be said about an image to the fundamentally pragmatic question of what should be said about it. Based on a variety of experiments with sighted and blind and low-vision participants, I will show that the pragmatic notion of contextual relevance is a core pillar of generating human-like image descriptions, provide evidence that our current tasks and evaluation tools in NLP remain unhelpful in uncovering these context effects, and present work that starts addressing this gap. Taken together, this work provides fundamental insights into how people communicate about the visual world, and shows how we can use those insights to advance VLMs for social impact, such as non-visual accessibility.

                <p><i>Runtime Analysis of Coevolutionary Algorithms on a Class of Symmetric Zero-Sum Games </i>&mdash; <a href="https://www.alistairbenford.com">Alistair Benford</a>, School of Computer Science, University of Birmingham, UK</p>
                <p>
                Coevolutionary algorithms (CoEAs) have a natural application to game playing. While this application has been extensively studied empirically, corresponding runtime analyses so far apply to only a few settings, 
                    leaving great potential for further theoretical investigation. Many games, whether enjoyed by human players or describing real-world competition, are symmetric (rules apply the same to all players) and 
                    zero-sum (one player's gain is another's loss).
                </p>
                <p>
                 With a view to advancing theoretical analysis of CoEAs, we consider a class of symmetric zero-sum games for which the role of population diversity is pivotal to an algorithm’s success. We prove that a broad class of 
                algorithms which do not utilise a population have superpolynomial runtime for this class. In the other direction we prove that, with high probability, a coevolutionary instance of the UMDA finds the unique Nash 
                equilibrium in time O(n(log(n))<sup>2</sup>). Together, these results indicate the importance of generating diverse search points for evolving better strategies.   
                </p>
                <p>
                In this talk we present these results, and additionally consider further runtime analysis for the performance of CoEAs on impartial combinatorial games.

                <p><i>Finding the Hidden Subset in Hidden Subset Problems </i> &mdash; <a href="https://research.birmingham.ac.uk/en/persons/jon-rowe">Jon Rowe</a>, University of Birmingham, UK</p>

                <p>
                    A hidden subset is defined on n bits, embedded in N bits (where N is typically much larger than n). The remaining N-n bits are neutral and do not affect the fitness of a string. There exist
                    evolutionary algorithms which find an optimal string in time that depends only on n and not on N for certain hidden subset problems. However, there seems to be no way for the algorithm to know 
                    when it has found the solution, nor can the relevant bits be identified once it has done so. We address this problem by running log(N) copies of the algorithm in parallel and taking a vote for 
                    the value in each bit position. Along the way, we prove a couple of lemmas of potentially broad application. The first gives an easy way of obtaining a bound on the time taken for a number of 
                    parallel runs of a process to complete. The second states that the probability a (1+1)EA, with any mutation scheme, produces an incorrect bit value, for weakly monotonic functions with a unique
                    optimum, is no greater than 1/2, at each time step.

                <p>
                    Co-evolutionary algorithms (CoEAs), which pair candidate designs with test cases, are frequently used in adversarial optimisation, particularly for binary test-based problems where 
                    designs and tests yield binary outcomes. The effectiveness of designs is determined by their performance against tests, and the value of tests is based on their ability to identify
                    failing designs, often leading to more sophisticated tests and improved designs. However, CoEAs can exhibit complex, sometimes pathological behaviours like disengagement. Through 
                    runtime analysis, we aim to rigorously analyse whether CoEAs can efficiently solve test-based adversarial optimisation problems in expected polynomial runtime. This paper carries
                    out the first rigorous runtime analysis of the (1,λ)CoEA for binary test-based adversarial optimisation problems. In particular, we introduce a binary test-based benchmark problem 
                    called "Diagonal Problem" and initiate the first runtime analysis of this competitive CoEA on this problem. The mathematical analysis shows that the (1,λ)CoEA can efficiently find an 
                    ε-approximation to the optimal solution of the "Diagonal Problem", i.e. in expected polynomial time assuming sufficiently low mutation rates and a large offspring population size.
                    On the other hand, the standard (1,λ)EA fails to find an ε-approximation to the optimal solution of the "Diagonal Problem" in polynomial time. This illustrates the potential of 
                    coevolution for solving binary adversarial optimisation problems.
